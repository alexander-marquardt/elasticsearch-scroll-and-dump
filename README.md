# elasticsearch-scroll-and-dump
A simple python script to scroll over an index and dump it to a file. 

This relies on the [Elasticsearch Python libraries](https://pypi.org/project/elasticsearch/), which can be installed using `pip install elasticsearch`. 

For a version of this code that does not require additional libraries, see:
